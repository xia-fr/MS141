    "[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) are a central concept in linear algebra and matrix theory. They find application in nearly all branches of science, including circuit analysis, stability and vibration analysis, finding the energy levels and wave functions in quantum mechanics, and solving partial differential equations. They are also used in facial recognition, machine learning, stochastic methods and Markov processes, and network theory, among other applications. \n",

    "$$ A \\bv = \\ll \\bv$$\n",

    "$$ \\det(A-\\ll I) = 0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation defines a characteristic polynomial $p(\\ll)$ of order $N$, with solutions equal to the eigenvalues of $A$. However, the textbook approach of finding the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors by solving the characteristic polynomial is not suitable for computation and is almost never employed. Polynomials of order greater than 4 do not have a closed form solution, and finding the roots of an $N$-dimensional polynomial (for example, with $N$ large) is computationally costly and can lead to large errors. In particular, the polynomial roots are very sensitive to small changes in the matrix $A$, so the approach is ill-conditioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic polynomial always has $N$ roots, and thus a matrix $A$ of size $N\\times N$ always has $N$ eigenvalues, although some may not be distinct (an eigenvalue may have multiplicity greater than 1). Most matrices of interest in science and engineering are symmetric or Hermitian and have $N$ linearly independent eigenvectors which can be made orthonormal. Some general matrices, however, are defective, and the number of eigenvectors is less than $N$. This typically occurs if the number of eigenvectors associated with one or more eigenvalues is less than their algebraic multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most numerical methods for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors are based on reducing the original matrix to a simpler form whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors are easily determined. Transformations that leave eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors unchanged or easily recoverable are central to these methods. Examples of these transformations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shift**: Subtracting a constant $\\sigma$ from the diagonal elements of a matrix, using $A-\\sigma I$, shifts all the eigenvalues by the constant value $\\sigma$ but leaves the eigenvectors unchanged: $(A-\\sigma I)\\bv = (\\lambda - \\sigma)\\bv$\n",
    "- **Powers**: If $A \\bv = \\ll \\bv$, then $A^2 \\bv = \\ll^2 \\bv$, and more generally $A^k \\bv = \\lambda^k \\bv$. \n",
    "- **Inverse**: The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are the inverse of the eigenvalues of $A$. Multiplying from the left $A\\bv=\\ll\\bv$ and rearranging, we get $A^{-1}\\bv=\\ll^{-1}\\bv$.\n",
    "- **Similarity**: Matrix $B$ is similar to matrix $A$ if there is a nonsingular matrix $Q$ such that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B = Q^{-1} A Q $$\n",

    "and thus using the transformation matrix $Q$ we can obtain the eigenvectors of $A$ as $\\bv = Q \\mathbf{u}$. Real symmetric matrices are a special case in which an orthogonal matrix, $Q^T=Q^{-1}$, can always be found that transforms $A$ into a similar diagonal matrix. The same is true for Hermitian matrices, for which a similarity transformation to diagonal form is accomplished by a unitary matrix $Q^\\dagger = Q^{-1}$. For general matrices the situation is more complex. Only general matrices with distinct eigenvalues can be transformed to diagonal form. General matrices with eigenvalues with multipliticity greater than one are more difficult as they can at best be put into block-triangular or nearly triangular or nearly diagonal form. We will not examine these cases in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagonal and triangular forms** are desirable targets for similarity transformations. The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries, and the eigenvectors are the corresponding columns of the identity matrix $I$. The eigenvalues of triangular matrices are also the diagonal entries. "

    "\n",
    "There are two useful variants of the power method. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The **inverse power method** allows one to find the *smallest* eigenvalue by (formally) applying the power method to $A^{-1}$. As we discussed above, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A^{-1} \\bv =\\, (1 / \\ll) \\,\\bv$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ A \\bx_{k+1} = \\bx_k, $$\n",
    " \n",
    "ideally with $LU$ decomposition to speed up the calculations. The example code given below illustrates the inverse power approach. An application of the inverse power method is finding the ground state or lowest-energy mode of a system. Coupled to the power method, one can find the range of eigenvalues in a system. In a physical problem, this may correspond to the range of time, length or energy scales involved, and thus is very useful to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The **shifted power method** is based on the idea that the eigenvalues of $A-\\sigma I$ are shifted (by the constant value $\\sigma$) compared to the eigenvalues of $A$, but the eigenvectors are unchanged: $(A-\\sigma I)\\bv = (\\lambda - \\sigma)\\bv$. Of course, the shift $\\sigma$ must be added to the result to obtain the eigenvalue of the original matrix $A$. One benefit of applying a shift is to accelerate convergence: since $\\left| \\frac{\\ll_2 - \\sigma}{\\ll_1-\\sigma} \\right|$ might be larger than $\\left| \\ll_2/\\ll_1\\right|$, the convergence of the power method can be accelerated. Shfits are widely used, for example in the $QR$ method (see below), to speed up convergence.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The shift can also be applied in the conjunction with the inverse power method to obtain a specific eigenvalue. In particular, the eigenvalue of $A-\\sigma I$ of smallest magnitude is $\\ll-\\sigma$, where $\\ll$ is the eigenvalue of $A$ closest to $\\sigma$. Thus, with an appropriate choice of shift, inverse iteration can be used to compute any eigenvalue and eigenvector pair of $A$, not just the extreme values."
