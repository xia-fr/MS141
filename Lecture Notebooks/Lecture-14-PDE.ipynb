It adds to the FTCS scheme discussed above a dissipative term proportional to the second spatial derivative similar to the one we encountered in the parabolic diffusion equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_{i}^{{n+1}} = u_{i}^{n} - \\frac{C}{2} \\left( u_{{i+1}}^{{n}}-u_{{i-1}}^{{n}} \\right) \n",

    "\n",
    "with $C= a \\Delta t / \\Delta x $. The addition of this term makes the FTCS scheme conditionally stable (for $C \\le 1$) at the cost of including an artificial diffusion term that tends to broaden the initial distribution. In the context of the Vlasov and Boltzmann equations, advection is often accompanied by a collision term, which similarly modifies the solution and partially stabilizes the FTCS scheme."

    "## Predictor-corrector method\n",
    "\n",
    "While the upwind method can provide a stable explicit scheme, there are several additional approaches for improving its accuracy. A possible improvement is to replace the Euler scheme with the 4th order Runge-Kutta method, which was described in a previous lecture. Here we will outline another approach: the predictor-corrector method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of predictor-corrector (PC) is, first, to calculate $u(t + \\Delta t)$ from $u(t)$ using an *explicit* method and then refine it using an _implicit_ method. The first step is called predictor and the second step corrector. In principle, one could apply a corrector step several times, but in practice, one corrector iteration is enough in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of explicit and implicit methods gives a stable and computationally efficient solver. The simplest realization of a PC scheme is to use forward Euler as predictor and Backward Euler as corrector. For the advection equation, this scheme becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Predictor step:* Calculate $u_E(x,t + \\Delta t)$ from $\\dfrac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial x}$ using forward Euler.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Corrector step:* Calculate $u(x,t + \\Delta t)$ from $\\dfrac{\\partial u_E(x,t+\\Delta t)}{\\partial x}$ using backward Euler.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the predictor-corrector technique consists of two or more steps, it is not possible to apply the Von Neumann stability analysis, although the stability can still be studied numerically. As a bonus content (courtesy of Dr. Ivan Maliyov), we implement below the PC approach for centered, forward, and backward spatial derivatives."

For the advection equation, we have found the following efficient scheme: Forward Euler as a predictor, backward Euler as corrector, and centered-space derivative."
